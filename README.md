# CSS-Only 3D Image Slider
This project is a clean, modern 3D image slider built entirely with HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript. It demonstrates how far CSS alone can go when it comes to creating visually engaging and interactive web components.

## About the Project
 This is a rotating 3D carousel that displays a series of images arranged in a circular layout. The central figure anchors the design, and each card or image rotates smoothly around it, creating a dynamic and immersive visual effect.

The concept was inspired by futuristic themes, and the entire slider is powered purely by CSS animations and transformations.

## Features

 Smooth 3D rotation effect using transform, perspective, and keyframes

 No JavaScript or external libraries required
